Each TDC count corresponds to 25/30 ns, whereas a unit of BX_COUNTER corresponds to 25 ns, and the ORBIT_CNT is increased every 'x' BX_COUNTER.

Finding the maximum wind speed occurring every 50 years requires the opposite approach, the result needs to be found from a defined probability. That is the quantile function role and the exercise goal will be to find it. In the current model, it is supposed that the maximum wind speed occurring every 50 years is defined as the upper 2% quantile.\n",

Thus it will be possible to calculate the cumulative probability of every measured wind speed maxima.
